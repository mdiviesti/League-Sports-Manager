# League-Sports-Manager
This is not ready for prime time. It is an under development API which I hope to get the Open Source Community involved with. 
League Sports Manager is an API written in Mongo, Express, and NodeJS designed to manage League Sporting events. Manage Players, Teams, Season Play, and Tournaments.
